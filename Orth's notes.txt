Resurrecting my notes because I may tinker further with this. Don't think I modified the 1vall/allv1 modes to account for all moves, rather than just the best moves. I think it should account for all moves, especially for cases where a powerful move might not be optimal in all scenarios (e.g. Explosion/Hyper Beam).
