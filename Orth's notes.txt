Issues- All v One KO chances not working- result is either "not a KO" or "[chance to KO/guaranteed] KO in undefined turns", with the latter only appearing if the move has a chance to OHKO. THIS ISSUE IS PRESENT ON THE OFFICIAL SITE AS WELL. Look into fixing this, and maybe make a separate pull request for any fix I find.

In order for guaranteed OHKO to be displayed (e.g. LO Zam HP Fire vs default Abomasnow set), it seems to need move.usedTimes and movem.metronomeCount to both equal 1. Neither property is present in the move object on the function. These properties are present in the one v all mode.
move.usedTimes in particular seems to be necessary, as other later outputs also depend on it- it being undefined seems to be the main reason these things aren't working.
The issue seems to arise in shared_controls function Pokemon. Interestingly, with the if/else that depends on the typeof pokeInfo being a string, the else statement explicitly adds all the data missing from av1. Doesn't make sense that there'd be an issue there though, since the data being passed should be exactly the same regardless of mode. Also need to track down the moves variable from this line in the if section
	var defaultDetails = moves[moveName] || moves['(No Move)'];
	Ok, that's declared 746 of shared_controls. It takes the appropriate generation's data from move_data. This data does not have the missing properties
	
Why the hell would this be written this way?

getMoveDetails (shared_controls 631) indicates that a lot of the missing info comes from user input. That'd explain why it's only affecting av1.
Still have no idea wtf the deal is with usedTimes. This is the code that sets it in getMoveDetails:
			usedTimes: defaultDetails.dropsStats ? ~~moveInfo.find(".stat-drops").val() : 1,
			
			
I think the solution is to simply add some code to honkalculate_controls making sure these properties are set if they are undefined. This would mean I need to determine what moves.usedTimes should be
