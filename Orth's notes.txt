Resurrecting my notes because I may tinker further with this. Don't think I modified the 1vall/allv1 modes to account for all moves, rather than just the best moves. I think it should account for all moves, especially for cases where a powerful move might not be optimal in all scenarios (e.g. Explosion/Hyper Beam). To do this, I'll have to tweak the code around line 100 in honkalculate_controls, as the highestDamage-maxDamage comparison is what's eliminating all but the top results

One thing to note- ripping sets directly from the smogdex isn't always the best- Zyg-C gets exported as "Zygarde", which gets you the base form in the calc. Not terribly important, but still worth noting
