OK wtf, everything's stopped working and I'm not sure why
1v1 seems to work fine
One v all returns this error when I try to calculate:
ReferenceError: mode is not defined[Learn More] honkalculate_controls.js:75:5

And filter moves seems to not recognise jquery, even though it seems to load the script just fine

NOTE: Recently merged from official branch, some things may have been changed? Should probably review


Things to do:
Really need to add JSON functionality to the calculator
Create resources for people to plug into the calculator (just txt file to be c/p'd)
Test more thoroughly. I honestly don't remember where I got to before because it's been a while since I worked on this. Maybe this'll be an opportunity to practice writing tests, because I've done a shoddy job of that in the past. At the very least, I haven't tested this for extremely large c/ps.
